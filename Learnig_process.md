#  Feynman Technique
### What is the Feynman Technique? Paraphrase the video in your own words.
Feynman Technique is a technique which is developed by the professor called Feynman. he belives that learning any thing can be difficult. so, he proposed this technique to learn the concepts in a simple way by following few steps. this technique is not only for the new concepts it also useful for the concepts which we won't understand.
### What are the different ways to implement this technique in your learning process? 
I will follow the steps which are in the Feynman Technique to learn the concepts which I don't understand.
There are four steps to follow they are,

 1. Select the concept and make the concept name as a heading in a peice of paper.
 2. Try to explain the concept in a simple way by yourself or to someone.
 3. Notedown the areas where your not good in the concept and use sources to solve it.
 4. Breakdown the words which you don't underatnd and break them into a simple thing.

By following this steps I can learn the concepts which I don't understand in a easy way.  
# Learning How to Learn
### Paraphrase the video in detail in your own words.
The videos is all about a woman called Barbara Oakley. In this video she shared some thechniques which can 
be used to learn any thing like painting, dancing etc,. she also says the implemation ways of the techniques. this are some techniques in the video that she said

 - Focus Mode and Diffuse Mode
 - Pomodoro Technique
 - Slow Thinking
### What are some of the steps that you can take to improve your learning process?
### 1. Focus Mode and Diffuse Mode
This technique is helpful to create any thing new and also to solve the problems what we are facing. 
In Focus Mode our mind can think in a difficult way to solve the problem and in Diffuse mode we can think freely which can be more efficient way.
### 2. Pomodoro Technique
This technique is very useful to learn anything new. The process of this technique is to study for 25 minutes without any distraction after that relax for 5 to 10 minutes and continue the process in this process we are not going put any pressure in our brain and we can study easily.
# Learn Anything in 20 hours  
### Your key takeaways from the video? Paraphrase your understanding.
In this video a man sharing problems he faced when he became a father and also he shares how he overcome it. the key takeaways from this video is the technique to learn any new things. while researching how to learn any new thing it will take around 10,000 hours i.e, almost 5 years of time to learn the new thing. so he said that we can learn anything in 20 hours by following some steps. they are,
 - Breaking the thing into smaller parts
 - Self correction
 - Remove practice barriers
 - Practice atleast 20 hours in a month
### What are some of the steps that you can while approaching a new topic?
I follow the steps which are said in the video. the steps are,
 - Breaking the thing into smaller parts : when you want to learn any new thing break the thing into parts so that you can understand the purpuse of each part in that thing.
 - Self correction : while learnig the new things we can make few mistakes we have to correct the mistakes without any skiping them.
 - Remove practice barriers : while practicing you have to maintain the practice place without things like TV, Phones etc,. so that it won't divert our mind.
 - Practice atleast 20 hours in a month : practicing over 20 hours per month will helpful to get the perfection on that thing.
