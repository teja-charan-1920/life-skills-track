#  Feynman Technique
### What is the Feynman Technique? Paraphrase the video in your own words.
Feynman Technique is a technique which is developed by a professor called Feynman. he believes that learning anything can be difficult. so, he proposed this technique to learn the concepts simply by following a few steps. this technique is not only for the new concepts it is also useful for the concepts which we won't understand.
### What are the different ways to implement this technique in your learning process? 
I will follow the steps which are in the Feynman Technique to learn the concepts which I don't understand.
There are four steps to follow they are,

 1. Select the concept and make the concept name a heading on a piece of paper.
 2. Try to explain the concept in a simple way by yourself or to someone.
 3. Notedown the areas where you're not good in the concept and use sources to solve it.
 4. Break down the words which you don't understand and break them into simple things.

By following these steps I can learn the concepts which I don't understand easily.  
# Learning How to Learn
### Paraphrase the video in detail in your own words.
The video is all about a woman called Barbara Oakley. In this video she shared some techniques which can 
be used to learn anything like painting, dancing, etc, She also says the implementation ways of the techniques. These are some techniques in the video that she said

 - Focus Mode and Diffuse Mode
 - Pomodoro Technique
 - Slow Thinking
### What are some of the steps that you can take to improve your learning process?
### 1. Focus Mode and Diffuse Mode
This technique is helpful to create anything new and also to solve the problems that we are facing. 
In Focus Mode our mind can think in a difficult way to solve the problem and in Diffuse mode we can think freely which can be a more efficient way.
### 2. Pomodoro Technique
This technique is very useful to learn anything new. The process of this technique is to study for 25 minutes without any distractions after that relax for 5 to 10 minutes and continue the process in this process we are not going to put any pressure on our brain and we can study easily.
# Learn Anything in 20 hours  
### Your key takeaways from the video? Paraphrase your understanding.
In this video, a man shares problems he faced when he became a father and also shares how he overcome them. the key takeaway from this video is the technique to learn new things. while researching how to learn any new thing it will take around 10,000 hours i.e., almost 5 years to learn the new thing. so he said that we can learn anything in 20 hours by following some steps. they are,
 - Breaking the thing into smaller parts
 - Self-correction
 - Remove practice barriers
 - Practice at least 20 hours in a month
### What are some of the steps that you can while approaching a new topic?
I follow the steps which are said in the video. the steps are,
 - Breaking the thing into smaller parts: when you want to learn any new thing break the thing into parts so that you can understand the purpose of each part in that thing.
 - Self-correction: while learning new things we can make a few mistakes we have to correct the mistakes without skipping them.
 - Remove practice barriers: while practicing you have to maintain the practice place without things like TV, Phones, etc, so that it won't divert our minds.
 - Practice at least 20 hours in a month: practicing over 20 hours per month will help to get perfection on that thing.
