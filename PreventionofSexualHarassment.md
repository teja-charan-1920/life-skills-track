### What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?
 -   Speak up: Clearly and firmly communicate that the behaviour is unwelcome and inappropriate. Clearly express your boundaries or let the person know that their actions are not acceptable.
 -  Document the incidents: Keep a record of the details of each incident, including dates, times, locations, and any witnesses present. This documentation can be useful if you decide to report the behaviour later.
 -   Seek support: Reach out to someone you trust, such as a friend, colleague, or supervisor, and share your experiences with them. They can provide emotional support and help you decide on the best course of action.
 -  Report the behaviour: If you feel safe and comfortable doing so, report the incidents to the appropriate authority in your organization or institution. This could be a supervisor, human resources department, or a designated reporting mechanism. Provide them with documented evidence, if available.
 - Know your rights: Familiarize yourself with the policies and procedures related to sexual harassment in your workplace or educational institution. Understand your rights and the steps that should be taken to address such incidents.
